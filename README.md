iRead.Kindle
============

A simple Django site for sharing Kindle highlights to Sina Weibo &amp; Douban broadcast(not yet supported).

### Introduction

iRead.Kindle is inspired by kindle.io (site: http://kindle.io/, source code: https://github.com/mitnk/kindleio), developed under Django-1.2.7 and host at SAE.

Now you can visit http://iread4kindle.sinaapp.com/ for sharing you Kindle highlights to Weibo. After you authorize to iRead.Kindle, it will fetch you latest Kindle highlights every 10 minutes and share to Weibo.


`**Just sharing :)**` from the author of kindle.io


iRead.Kindle is now an __incomplete__ service, there exists many terrible BUGs, the source code is ugly, howerver, `__Done is better than perfect__`, so I published it just for fun ;-)
